Paper Towel Picker saves you money at the grocery store! We've all been there, faced with the insurmountable wall of paper towels: $18.79 for 12 giant rolls, $19.79 for 8 huge rolls, $19.99 for 12 mega rolls... but which one is the best price?! Paper Towel Picker compares them all and tells you the best deal!

Paper Towel Picker does the math for you! Just enter the price and count for each product with the super simple interface, and Paper Towel Picker automatically calculates the price per item, compares them all, and highlights the best bargain.
