Tipulator makes tipping simple! Built from the ground up to look and feel like a modern iOS app, Tipulator is a great looking and easy to use tip calculator. Personalize Tipulator's appearance to make it look and work the way you want!

• Quick and easy interface—just enter the check total at the top, and the tip and grand total update automatically
• Edit any field—enter the tip percentage or the tip value itself, or enter the grand total to have the corresponding tip calculated
• Deducts the tax amount or tax rate for you
• Splits the check for you and your party—no limit to the party size either!
• Tax deduction and check splitting can be hidden completely to keep the interface clean if you like
• Rounding supported—intuitive +1 and -1 buttons on the keyboard making rounding to the nearest dollar easy (or adding an extra dollar to the tip) without cluttering up the screen with lots of extra buttons everywhere
• 3 star or 1 star service? Preset service rating stars make it quick to change the tip and can even be assigned custom values
• Customizable appearance lets you change the background and foreground color, or set your own photo as the background wallpaper
• Supports large font sizes with Apple's Dynamic Type system making Tipulator easy to read

Take Tipulator out to dinner today!
